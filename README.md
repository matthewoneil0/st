# Matthew's build of st 

Hello, this is my backup of my st, suckless simple terminal setup.

## Current applied patches

+ **scrollback** using `shift+PgUp` and `shift+PgDwn`
+ **scrollback** using scroll functions (trackpoint, or mouse pad)
+ **transparency**, thanks to the alpha patch. (requires X compositor, I use Xrender)

## Font

+ **Hack Nerd Font** is the current font I use, mainly for [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

## Future adds

+ **Colors**, maybe patching with dracula or Nord
+ **Anything else**. I just installed this yesterday so I'm sure I'll find 
many more cool things to add to it.
