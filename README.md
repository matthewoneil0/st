# Matthew's build of st 

Hello, this is my backup of my st, suckless simple terminal setup.

## Current applied patches

+ **scrollback** using `shift+PgUp` and `shift+PgDwn`
+ **scrollback** using scroll functions (trackpoint, or mouse pad)
+ **transparency**, thanks to the alpha patch. (requires X compositor, I use Xrender)

## Font

+ [**Hack Nerd Font**](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) is the current font I use, mainly for [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

## Future adds

+ **Colors**, maybe patching with [dracula](https://st.suckless.org/patches/dracula/) or [Nord](https://st.suckless.org/patches/nordtheme/).
+ **Anything else**. I just installed this yesterday so I'm sure I'll find 
many more cool things to add to it.

## Update

st doesn't support emojis! yaaaayyyy.. and the only patch is from the AUR and I run noobuntu.
Until I move to Arch, I will will probably use Konsole. Until then,,
